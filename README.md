# Calendar
Create a calendar using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Introduction
This project was made to practice using JavaScript to create a simple functioning calendar. The calendar should accept a date that the user specifies. It will resemble the input for a booking service. The inspiration is based on user inputs for restaurant and travel websites.
