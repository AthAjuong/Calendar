# Calendar
Create a calendar using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Introduction
This project was made to practice using JavaScript to create a simple functioning calendar. The calendar should accept a date that the user specifies. It will resemble the input of a booking service. The inspiration is based on the standard Windows 10 calendar, and typical user inputs for restaurant and travel websites.

## Functionality
This calendar only focuses on front-end interactivity. It needs should fulfill the front-end functionality a typical digital calendar does.

Users should be able to:
* See today's date
* Cycle through different months
* Select a specific date
* Select a date range
